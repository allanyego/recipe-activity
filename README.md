# recipe-activity

Hi, this is my activity app. To use it, you will need to run `npm install` on both **recipe-activity/backend** and **recipe-activity/frontend** folders after cloning this repository.

From inside **recipe-activity/backend** run `node server.js` or `nodemon`, if you have it installed and inside **recipe-activity/frontend** run `ng serve` to get the frontend server up
