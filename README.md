Hi, this is my activity app. To use it, you will need to run `npm install` on both [backend](https://github.com/yegow/recipe-activity/tree/master/backend) and [frontend](/frontend/) folders after cloning this repository.

From inside [backend](https://github.com/yegow/recipe-activity/tree/master/backend) run `node server.js` or `nodemon`, if you have it installed and inside [frontend](/frontend/) run `ng serve` to get the frontend server up
