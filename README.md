Hi, this is my activity app. To use it, you will need to run `npm install` on both [backend](/backend/) and [frontend](/frontend/) folders after cloning this repository.

From inside [backend](/backend/) run `node server.js` or `nodemon`, if you have it installed and inside [frontend](/frontend/) run `ng serve` to get the frontend server up
